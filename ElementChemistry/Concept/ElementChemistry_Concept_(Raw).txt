ElementCompound,ElementMaterial and ElementTable Concepts

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Element Table is the Read Only File, that contains some general data about elements, such as names, valence...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Element Material is a Structure that merely counts the amount of Elements in some material.
Like a "100 Units of Iron and 30 Units of Copper" Sword.

The count will be used mostly to keep track on the elements, for dismantling, and alchemy.
But most importantly, it will define the Stats of the Item it is being used on.

The changes each element applies to a piece of item, still being elaborated.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Element Compound is a Better version of Element material, it keep tracks of the Connection Between elements.

the connection of elements is based on real life chemistry, by dealing with valence.

by my(the author) knowledge of chemistry is very limited, so i came up with some abstractions and simplifications:

the only relevant connections for the compound, is made between non metalic Elements.

Since there is 8 Non metalic elements, there will be 35 Different Relevant Connections!

Each connection will have some unique effect, like Healing 5% of the HP.

Spending Multiple amounts of points of valence in a single connection, will result in a multiple effectiviness.

For example: lets imagine that i have an element A, with Valence -4,
Element B with Valence -3,Element C with Valence -3 and Element D with Valence -2

if in some solution i have Element A, alone, i will have total valence of -4

lets say that i add Element B to the mixture, the result of the valence exange will be -1 Total Valence
But since there is a difference of 3 Valence, it will be added 3 Connections to the Compound.(3xA+B)

now lets say that we add element C, the total valence now will be -2, But the difference was only 1.(1xA+C)

finally, lets stabilize the compound, by adding element D, the total valence will be 0, with 2 connections made.(2xC+D)

Final Compound:
3 AB
1 AC
2 CD
Final Material:
1 A
1 B
1 C
1 D

if we suppose that this is a potion, and the connection AB heals 5% HP, AC heals 5% SP and CD gives 1s Invisibility:
we will have a potion that Heals 15%HP, heals 5%SP and gives 2 seconds of invisibility!
